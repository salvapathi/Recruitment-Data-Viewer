The "ISCS Recruitment Data Viewer" project leverages Streamlit, MySQL, and Pandas to provide a streamlined interface for exploring recruitment data. 
The application allows users to retrieve and display recruitment records based on various search criteria,
including Recruiter, Mobile Number, and Technology.
Using a combination of Python and MySQL, the application establishes a connection to a local database, retrieves data based on the user's selected criteria, 
and presents it in a tabular format. The UI is enhanced with custom styles to ensure readability and visual appeal.
